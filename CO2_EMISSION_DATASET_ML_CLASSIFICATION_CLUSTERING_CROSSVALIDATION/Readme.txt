THIS IS MY FINAL PROJECT OF MACHING LEARNING COURSE. THE WORK IN ABOUT TO USE ALMOST 6 CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS AND COLLECT THE PERFERMONACES SUCH AS ACCURACY, PRECISION, RECALL, F1-SCORES. AFTER THAT, USE 10 K-FOLD CROSSESVALIDATION WITH EACH CLASSIFATION ALGORITHM AND STORE THE PERFORMANCES OF EVERY FOLD. THEN MAKE THE DATASET UNSUPERVISED AND THEN USE CLUSTERING ALGORITHM, STORE THE CLUSTERED DATASET. AFTER THAT, AGAIN USE CLASSIFICATION ALGORTHMS OVER THE CLUSTERED DATASETS AND COMPARE THE RESULT.
